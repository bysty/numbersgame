The Numbers Game is a quick and intense way to decide who pays the dinner bill. In this game, guessing the secret number means you lose and pay the bill for the round.
Setup

    No initial pot contribution from everyone. Money is only contributed by the player who guesses the number.
    The Host: The player who starts the round is designated as the Host. This role rotates with each new round.

How to Play

    Host's Secret Number: The Host secretly chooses a whole number between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and writes it down, hidden from other players.
    First Guess: The player to the left of the Host makes the first guess by choosing a whole number between 1 and 100.
    Narrowing the Range:
        The Host announces a new, narrower range based on the guess. The goal is to get closer to the Host's secret number without hitting it.
        If the guess is lower than the secret number, the Host announces, "Okay, the number is between [Guess] and [Current Upper Bound]."
        If the guess is higher than the secret number, the Host announces, "Okay, the number is between [Current Lower Bound] and [Guess]."
        The range always starts with 1 and 100 initially.
        Example: If the Host chose 25 and the guesser chose 50, the Host would say, "Okay, the number is between 1 and 50." If the next guesser chose 10, the Host would say, "Okay, the number is between 10 and 50."
    Continuing Play: Play continues clockwise. Each subsequent player must choose a number within the most recently announced range.
    The Loser (and Payer!): The player who guesses the exact secret number loses the round. This player must:
        Pay $10 to the pot.
        Become the new Host for the next round.
        The game continues until the bill needs to be paid.

Ending the Game and Paying the Bill

    The game continues for multiple rounds, with the pot accumulating money from each player who guesses the number.
    When it's time to pay the dinner bill, the money in the accumulated pot is used to pay for it.

House Rules & Clarifications

    No Repeats: Players cannot guess a number that has already been announced as part of the range or an exact guess.
    Honesty: The Host must be honest about their secret number and the announced ranges.
    The "Bill" Pot: The money in the pot is specifically for paying the dinner bill.
    Winning (Avoiding Loss): The goal is to not be the player who guesses the exact number.
